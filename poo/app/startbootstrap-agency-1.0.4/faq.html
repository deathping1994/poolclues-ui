                                We define the pool as 'any plan or activity like a movie, party, trip or more that you would like to carry out with your friends/colleagues'. Our mission is to enable the same at one place where you and your friends can discuss, chat together as well as pay your own shares for the same. Then, you can redeem the complete amount quickly instead of going through bank transfers, cash handling or the uncomfortable 'You Owe Me's.

In this case, each of them would get the link to 'Pay Share' in their inbox via MyPoolin. However, you will notice that it becomes very convenient to invite via a single click if they are already in your Gmail contacts.
