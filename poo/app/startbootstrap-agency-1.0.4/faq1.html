                    <p>We define the pool as a plan to get a gift that you would like to carry out with your friends/colleagues'. Our mission is to enable the same at one place where you and your friends can discuss, chat together as well as pay your own shares for the same. Then, you can redeem the complete amount quickly instead of going through bank transfers, cash handling or the uncomfortable 'You Owe Me's.</p>
